                    <p>The tribes of Jharkhand consist of 32 tribes inhabiting the Jharkhand state in India.
                        The tribes in
                        Jharkhand were originally classified on the basis of their cultural types by the Indian
                        anthropologist, Lalita Prasad Vidyarthi. The Scheduled Tribe (ST) population of Jharkhand State
                        is
                        as per 2001 census 7,087,068 constituting 26.3 per cent of the total population (26,945,829) of
                        the
                        State. The Scheduled Tribes are primarily rural as 91.7per cent of them reside in villages.
                        District
                        wise distribution of ST population shows that Gumla district has the highest proportion of STs
                        (68.4per cent). The STs constitute more than half of the total population in Lohardaga and
                        Pashchimi
                        Singhbhum districts whereas Ranchi and Pakaur districts have 41.8 – 44.6 per cent tribal
                        population.

                    <p>The word "Jhar" means 'forest' and "Khand" means 'land' in various Indo-Aryan languages.
                        Thus
                        "Jharkhand" means forest land.
                        In the ancient period, in the Mahabharata, the region was referred as Kark Khand due to location
                        near Kark Rekha i.e. Tropic of Cancer. During the Medieval period, the region was known as
                        Jharkhand. According to Bhavishya Purana (1200 CE), Jharkhand was one of the seven Pundra desa.
                        The
                        name is first found on a 13th-century copper plate in Kendrapada, Odisha region from the reign
                        of
                        Narasimha Deva II of Eastern Ganga dynasty. Forest land from Baidhnath dham to Puri was known as
                        Jharkhand.</p>
