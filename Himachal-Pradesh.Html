            <p style="font-style: normal; text-align: justify">
              Till 19th century, Tourism in Himachal Pradesh was restricted only
              to a limited movement of pilgrims to a few spiritual destinations
              in around the hills. Only when the British established their chain
              of hill stations did tourism receive recognition in the State.
              Tourism activity received a shot in the arm when British declared
              Shimla “The Summer Capital of India” in 1864. Post independence,
              more investment in the infrastructure sector led to opening up of
              Tourism in the State. However the biggest boost to tourism
              occurred in the mid 80s and 90s.

              The people of Himachal celebrate life every day, and it’s apparent

            <h3>Art</h3>
            <p>
              The art of Himachal has grown out from a fusion of cultural
              strains, migrations and religious beliefs. Several surviving works
              have found expression in wall murals, illustrated books,
              miniatures and religious paintings. Patronized by the rulers of
              hill valley kingdoms, indigenous art forms blended with Mughal
              style blossomed into what collectively has come to known as the
              famed Kangra school of paintings. Regional specific art styles in
              Basholi Kalam, Kangra Kalam, Mandi Kalam, Chamba Kalam, Guler
              Kalam, Kullu Kalam, Arki Kalam, Bilaspur Kalam, Nurpur Kalam and
              others can only be differentiated by connoisseurs and collectors.
              Religious Tibetan art, under the patronage of monasteries in
              Kinnaur, Lahaul & Spiti, achieved a brilliance of its own.

            <p>
              The natural splendour of Himachal has an influence on the crafts
              native to the region. From the low-lying plains of Kangra to the
              majestic landscape of Lahaul, Himachal has a rich wealth of crafts
              which has found expression in exquisite wood carvings, beautiful
              metalware, gracious jewellery patterns, sermons in stone craft and
              others. Traversing the land, one may stumble upon great works of
              art and craftsmanship in remote village and valleys. Hidden
              pockets of local talent have survived the times at many places in
              the hills.

            <h3>Music</h3>
            <p>
              The songs and music echo the cultural richness of the land.
              Plethora of soul-touching folk songs capture the beliefs, history,
              love tales, heroic deeds, hard times, parting, mysteries of life
              and death and other themes in the local idiom. These traditional
              songs have a soothing charm even when sung without accompanying
              musical instruments. Most of the Himachali songs are centred on
              the respect and gratitude for gods, the splendour of changing
              seasons and the warmth of love ballads. These melodic songs
              combine with the sublime dance forms and musical instruments at
              important festivals, rituals, fairs and small festivities which
              celebrate the mysteries of life. Natives living in the far off
              valleys sing these tunes that binds the community together in its
              isolation, especially in winters.

            <h3>Dance</h3>
            <p>
              There are both solo and group dances in Himachal. Solo dances are
              popular in Bilaspur, Solan, Sirmaur and parts of Shimla. In
              Bilaspur it is called Gidha, in Sirmaur and parts of Shimla it is
              Munjara. Solo dances are usually performed in the open but evening
              dances are held in covered courtyards or large rooms. The Nati, a
              group dance of Mandi, Shimla, Kullu, Sirmaur, Kinnaur and Chamba
              in which hundreds of people take part, has become the most popular
              dance form of the state. Performed in open spaces, at temple
              courtyards, the dancers form a circle which allows both swaying to
              the tune and synchronized movement to step styles that can vary
              from valley to valley and region to region. Ample diversity of
              local cultures is seen in the dance styles of Nati performances.
              Both men and women participate in a Nati, mostly in separate
              groupings.

              Drawn from the farms and pastures the land grows, many dishes make
              a liberal use of the produce, herbs, nuts, fruits, milk and milk
              products. In many belts, non-vegetarian food is the norm and most
              meals are centered around meat, cereals and lentils. Leafy
              vegetables are only a recent induction into the Himachali palate.
              Community feasts prepared for ‘Dhams’ by hereditary clans of Boti
              chefs is where the traditional flavours are at their best. A Mandi
              Dham is much different from a Chamba, Kangra, Bilaspur, Shimla,
              Sirmaur or Kullu Dham. Each region or valley has its own set of
              favourite dishes, cooked in a distinctly different style which
              makes these feasts very popular at food festivals or when
              partaking in one during a visit to any of these regions. A typical
              Chamba Dham would open with rice and green lentils (moong daal),
              followed by Madrah (kidney beans or white grams cooked in
              yoghurt), boor ki kari and dark lentils (mash ki daal). The meal
              is tapered with Khutta made of Gur (brown sugar) and tamarind and
              for a dessert there is Mittha – sweetened rice, richly garnished
              with raisins and dry fruits. In the highlands of Lahaul, Spiti and
              Kinnaur, food has marked Tibetan influence with most dishes made
              out of coarse grains of buckwheat, millet and barley that are
              locally grown. Thupa, a popular dish, has meat chunks, vegetables
              and noodles dipped in a fiery curry. Butter tea (Salty tea), known
              as Thang in Kinnaur/Spiti is made by vigorous churning of butter,
              salt and special tea leaves. For the long cold winter months this
              a very energising beverage. The Momo, a Tibetan dish, is a very
              popular street food readily available in Shimla, Manali,
              Dharamshala, Dalhousie and other places. Cooked vegetables or
              minced meat with seasoning and spices is wrapped in wheat flour
              dough. After steaming them, Momo’s are ready to be served. With
              spicy chutney, this dish is a hot selling snack food.

            <h3>River Rafting</h3>
            <p>
              Rushing downstream with the strong river flows, negotiating
              turbulent rapids, water droplets hitting you in the face; white
              water rafting is an adventure sport that gets up the adrenalin
              working thick and fast. Rivers born in Himalayan glacial valleys
              make a rapid descent before entering the plains and on the course
              they have cut out graded stretches that have attracted white water
              rafters from India and overseas. Guided rafting is conducted on
              river Sutlej at Tattapani near Shimla, at Pirdi on the Beas river
              near Kullu, on the Ravi river near Chamba, and for the expert on
              the more daring rapids of Chandra, Spiti rivers in Lahaul and
              Spiti district. River Beas from Manali to Bhuntar, a stretch of 50
              km with a number of rapids, is most popular for recreational river
              rafting runs. Riding a raft over gentle, sometimes foaming waves
              and dashing against rocks and boulders is a thrill to experience.

              that with a gush of moderate winds make for a good take-off with
              the landing being at the terraced grounds of Bir. Other delightful
              sites for paragliding in Himachal include Bandla Dhar near
              Bilaspur and Solang valley near Manali. In solo paragliding,
              trained pilots fly alone in a paraglider, whereas in Tandem

              to have him experience the thrill of free flying. Tandem flights
              are what most enthusiasts love to indulge in. For those wanting to
              take up the adventure sport, Himachal Tourism conducts training
              programmes at Bir and Dharamsala (Kangra). A new paragliding site
