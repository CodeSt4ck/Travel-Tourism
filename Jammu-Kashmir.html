            <h2>HISTORY</h2>
            <p>
              Cradled amidst the snow clad Himalayas, the state of Jammu &
              Kashmir was one of the major centres for learning Sanskrit since
              the ancient times. This fact is supplemented by several evidences
              in the great Hindu epic Mahabharata. The word “Kashmir” is
              believed to have originated from Sanskrit. In Sanskrit: “Ka” means
              'water' and “shimeera” means 'desiccate'. According to a Hindu
              mythology, Kashmir valley was once the holy lake Satisar (the lake
              of goddess Sati or Durga), which was drained by the great saint
              Kashyapa (the grandson of Lord Brahma). The brahmins of the nearby
              areas then inhabited it.

              The challenging peaks of the Himalayas offer endless adventure,
              cultural learning and recreational opportunities. Mountaineering
              in the Himalayas on some of the world's greatest peaks is a
              lifetime experience. Kashmir, Zanskar, Kishtwar and Ladakh are the
              four zones in the state of Jammu and Kashmir that are important
              for mountaineering. Pahalgam, Gulmarg, Sonamarg and a few other
              places serve as the base camps for tours to the mountain peaks.
              Scaling high altitude mountains is gaining popularity among the
              youth. Even amateur mountain climbers wish to enjoy mountaineering
              trips and expeditions. One needs to take permission from the
              Government of India through the Indian Mountaineering Foundation
              (IMF) for mountaineering in Kashmir.

            <h3>Trekking</h3>
            <p>
              Multi-day hiking trips through mountainous ranges and snow deserts
              is truly a dream for a trekker. Trekking forms an integral part of
              the adventure sports flourishing in the hilly tracts of Jammu and
              Kashmir. The state is an ultimate paradise for trekkers. There are
              several routes passing through snowy hills, glaciers, and valleys
              for adventurous trekking. Hemis-Markha-Padum trek (13 days trek)
              and Chaddar (separating the Indus Valley from Zanskar) are amongst
              the best and most exciting trek routes in the world. Jammu,
              Ladakh, Gulmarg, Kishtwar are few places where trekking through
              the woods and the hills can be enjoyed.

            <h3>Trout Fishing</h3>
            <p>
              The beautiful geographical variations of the state of Jammu and
              Kashmir, along the course of each river and lake, offer endless
              possibilities for anglers. The various waterways, crisscrossing
              the state, are important fishing retreats rich in trout. The state
              of Jammu and Kashmir is known as a paradise for fishing
              enthusiasts. The streams and lakes have plenty of brown and
              rainbow trout, but it is necessary to have a permit to go fishing.
              The credit for introducing these brown and rainbow trout to the
              streams of Kashmir goes to the British. The wide silvery network
              of rivers and streams as well as high altitude lakes, including
              Sind and Lidder Rivers, Dal Lake, Jhelum River, etc. abound in
              trout- both brown and rainbow. The region with pure mountain air,
              serenity, tranquility, lush meadows and magnificent clear lakes
              with a series of tributaries and streams offer the best experience
              of trout fishing. Most of these rivers are covered with snow,
              which start melting between the months of May to July. The
              activity is a once in a lifetime experience.

            <h3>Safari</h3>
            <p>
              Wish to explore the wilds or the remote snowy areas of the
              Himalayas?- the best option is to board a jeep. It is the most
              secure way to travel while exploring the wild species in the dense
              woods or driving over rocky hills. Jeep Safaris prove to be the
              best way to get an inside look of the forests and its topography.
              Jeeps provide comfort amidst every adverse situation, be it the
              narrow mountainous highways even. While enjoying a jeep sfari, one
              can discover the hidden mysteries of the Himalayan region.
              Starting from religious temples located atop the high mountain
              ranges to the distinct and endangered species of the wilds, a Jeep
              takes you wherever you want to go. Undoubtedly, trekking is an
              adventurous way to explore the region, but as it is restricted to
              the relatively healthier people, the Jeep Safari comes in handy
              for one to access a desired dream destintion.
