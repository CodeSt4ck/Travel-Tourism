          "Uttar Pradesh is a state in northern India. With over 200 million
          inhabitants, it is the most populated state in India as well as the
          most populous country subdivision in the world. It was established in
          1950 after India had become a republic. It was a successor to the
          United Provinces (UP) during the period of the Dominion of India
          (1947–1950), which in turn was a successor to the United Provinces
          (UP) established in 1935, and eventually of the United Provinces of
          Agra and Oudh established in 1902 during the British Raj. The state is
          divided into 18 divisions and 75 districts, with the state capital
          being Lucknow, and Allahabad (Prayagraj) serving as the judicial
          capital. On 9 November 2000, a new state, Uttaranchal (now
          Uttarakhand), was created from Uttar Pradesh's western Himalayan hill
          region."

      <h3>History</h3>
      <div class="content">
        <img src="./Images//UP/history.jpg" alt="" class="image" />
        <p>
          "The history of Uttar Pradesh the Northern Indian state, stretches
          back technically to its formation on 1 April 1937 as the North-Western
          Provinces of Agra and Awadh, but the region itself shows the presence
          of human habitation dating back to between 85,000 and 73,000 years
          ago. The region seems to have been domesticated as early as 6,000 BC.
          The early modern period in the region started in 1526 after Babur
          invaded the Delhi Sultanate, and established the Mughal Empire
          covering large parts of modern Uttar Pradesh. The remnants of the
          Mughal Empire include their monuments, most notably Fatehpur Sikri,
          Allahabad Fort, Agra Fort, and the Taj Mahal. The region was the site
          of the Indian Rebellion of 1857, with revolts at Meerut, Kanpur, and
          Lucknow. The region was also a site for the Indian Independence
          movement with the Indian National Congress. After independence in
          1947, the United Provinces were renamed Uttar Pradesh in 1950. In
          2000, the state of Uttarakhand was carved out from Uttar pradesh."

          Mughlai cuisine is a style of cooking developed in the Indian
          subcontinent by the imperial kitchens of the Mughal Empire. It
          represents the cooking styles used in North India, especially Uttar

          Awadhi cuisine from the city of Lucknow consists of both vegetarian
          and non-vegetarian dishes. It has been greatly influenced by Mughlai
