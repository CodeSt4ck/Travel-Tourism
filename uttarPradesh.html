        <h3>History</h3>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"The history of Uttar Pradesh the Northern Indian state, stretches back technically to its formation on 1
                April 1937 as the North-Western Provinces of Agra and Awadh, but the region itself shows the presence of
                human habitation dating back to between 85,000 and 73,000 years ago. The region seems to have been
                domesticated as early as 6,000 BC.

                The early modern period in the region started in 1526 after Babur invaded the Delhi Sultanate, and
                established the Mughal Empire covering large parts of modern Uttar Pradesh. The remnants of the Mughal
                Empire include their monuments, most notably Fatehpur Sikri, Allahabad Fort, Agra Fort, and the Taj
                Mahal.

                The region was the site of the Indian Rebellion of 1857, with revolts at Meerut, Kanpur, and Lucknow.
                The region was also a site for the Indian Independence movement with the Indian National Congress.

                After independence in 1947, the United Provinces were renamed Uttar Pradesh in 1950.

                In 2000, the state of Uttarakhand was carved out from Uttar pradesh."
